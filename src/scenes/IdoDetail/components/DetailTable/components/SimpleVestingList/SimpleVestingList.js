        All Sale participants got a 3,3+ NFT airdropped on Polygon to their wallet, which represents and includes the number of tokens purchased. A 25x multiplier will be applied to the unvested token quantity with four-year locking schedule. 

        <ul>
                <li> Example: A 20 USDT investment will produce a 3,3+ NFT with 10 TNGBL tokens (Sale token price was $2).
                </li>
                Those tokens will multiply to a total of 250 over the course of four years.
                <li>In general you will have your purchased token ammount vested by approximately the 9th month, at which point you can liquidate your position, claiming those tokens but
                forfeiting all future multipliers.</li>
        </ul>
