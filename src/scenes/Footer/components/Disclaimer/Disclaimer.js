            It is strongly recommended that you seek professional investment advice before making

        <h6>Risk Warnings</h6>
        <p>
            There are significant risks associated with an investment in any products or services 
            provided by PEAKDEFI. Investment in the products and services is intended only for those 
            investors who can accept the risks associated with such an investment (including the risk 
            of a complete loss of investment) and you should ensure you have fully understood such risks before
             taking any decision to invest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Past performance does not guarantee future performance and the value of investments can fall as 
            well as rise. No investment strategy is without risk and markets influence investment performance. 
            Investment markets and conditions can change rapidly. Strategies or products can lose money as 
            well as gain. All investors should consider investing only if they can accept the risks associated 
            with investing including a loss of invested capital. No investor should invest without a thorough 
            reading of the risk factors associated with each investment strategy in official documentation 
            provided for each fund or strategy. Investors with questions should additionally seek independent 
            investment advice tailored to their needs, circumstances, and risk tolerances.
