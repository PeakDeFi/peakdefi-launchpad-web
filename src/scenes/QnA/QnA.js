        {
            q: "How much PEAK tokens can I stake?",
            a: "The number of PEAK tokens you can stake is not limited. But for participating in our Sales, you must stake a minimum of 1,000 PEAK tokens."
        },

        {
            q: "What does the penalty fee exactly mean?",
            a: "You can unstake your tokens at any given time, but in order to incentive people to stake PEAK tokens continuously, we charge a penalty fee. The fee equals 0% after a period of 8 weeks."

        // {
        //     q: "How are the commissions paid out?",
        //     a: "The commissions are always paid in PEAK tokens."

        // {
        //     q: "How often gets the claimable number of PEAK tokens refreshed?",
        //     a: "Due to our smart contract logic, your claimable number of PEAK tokens gets refreshed every 4 hours. Please be aware that before a minimum of 4 hours, you wonâ€™t see any referrals."
        // },

        {
            q: "Is there a referral programme?",
            a: "There was a referral programme which expired at the end of July 2023. Currently, the Peakdefi team is developing an improved programme which will come in Q4 2023."
