                        consent and agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that your understanding of this Clause is up
                        to date. Subject to applicable laws, your continued use of your PEAKDEFI Platform’s account will be
                        interpreted as your acceptance of any modifications to Clause 15 regarding the Parties' Agreement to
                        Arbitrate. You agree that if you object to the modifications to Clause 15, we may block access to your
